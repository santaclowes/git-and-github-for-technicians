# Git and GitHub for Technicians Example Repository

This repository is a simple example created as part of the git and GitHub for technicians workshop session run as part of the Institute for Technical Skills and Strategy (ITSS) WinterFest event series.

### What files are here?

The repo contains a mock top-level configuration file for a 3D printer setup and a directory  (`job_configs`) for storing a set of standard job configurations used within our invented fabrication lab!

### Still to do

There are a few tasks that still need to be done here:

- Add a space for our lab SOPs and begin adding them
- Create space for configurations for other instruments and machines in the lab
- Restructure the files to put the 3D printing content in its own sub-directory alongside content for other lab machines.
- ...

### Licence

The content in this repository is under an open licence (CC-Y-4.0) in the hope that other lab managers will find it useful and take advantage of the structure here to manage their own open lab profiles, configurations and protocols.x
